# Don't bring slop to a slop fight

Whenever I talk about [generative AI slop](https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports) being sent into
every conceivable communication platform I see a common
suggestion on how to stop the slop from reaching human eyes:

<div><center><blockquote>“Just use AI to detect the AI”</blockquote></center></div>

We're already seeing companies offer this arrangement as a service.
Just a few days ago [Cloudflare announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/)
they would use generative AI to create an infinite "labyrinth"
for trapping AI crawlers in pages of content and links.

This suggestion is flawed because doing so props up the
real problem: **generative AI is heavily subsidized**.
In reality generative AI is so expensive we're talking about [restarting
nuclear and coal power plants and reopening copper mines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ouNbLgJEHA), people.
There is no universe that this service should allow
users to run queries without even a credit card on file.

Today
this subsidization is mostly done by venture capital who want to see
the technology integrated into as many verticals as possible.
The same strategy was used for Uber and WeWork where
venture capital allowed those companies to undercut
competition to have wider adoption and put competitors
out of business.

So using AI to detect and filter AI content just means
that there'll be *even more generative AI* in use,
not less. This isn't the signal we want to send to
the venture capitalists who are deciding whether to offer
these companies more investment money. We want that "monthly active user" (MAU)
graph to be flattening or decreasing.

We got a sneak peek at the real
price of generative AI from OpenAI where [a future top-tier model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents/?guccounter=1) (as of March 5th, 2025)
is supposedly going to be $20,000 USD *per month*.

That's sounds more like it. The sooner we get to unsubsidized generative AI
pricing the better we'll all be, including the planet. So let's hold out for that future
and think
asymmetrically, not symmetrically, on methods to make generative AI slop not viable until we get there.
