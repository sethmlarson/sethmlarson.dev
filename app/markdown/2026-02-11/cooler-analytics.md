# Cooler Analytics

[You don't need analytics on your blog](https://blog.yossarian.net/2023/12/24/You-dont-need-analytics-on-your-blog), but maybe you need analytics for your cooler?

Last Sunday was the Superbowl in the USA, where *former Vikings quarterback*
[Sam Darnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold#Minnesota_Vikings) and the Seahawks trounced the Patriots <nobr>29–13</nobr>.
We were also reminded who the top players are in the USA economy. Surprise, it's
still generative AI, cryptocurrencies, sports betting, and surveillance.

Anyway,
Trina and I hosted a Superbowl watch-party and I take pride in
stocking the coolers. I usually do some combination of vibes-based
“what was popular last time” and introducing a new wild-card item to see if
something sticks. I am a big believer in human-based curation, and this is
that at a much smaller scale. Just for fun I calculated the actual “analytics”
of the coolers from this party:

| Beverage                | Alc? | floz / Unit | Delta (Units) | # Before | # After |
|-------------------------|:----:|-------------|--------------:|---------:|--------:|
| Diet Dr. Pepper         |  No  | 12          |            -4 |       12 |       8 |
| Diet Coke               |  No  | 12          |            -3 |       12 |       9 |
| Coke Zero Mini (1)      |  No  | 7.5         |            -3 |       10 |       7 |
| Chi Forest              |  No  | 11.16       |           -12 |       24 |      12 |
| Pineapple Juice         |  No  | 8           |            -3 |       24 |      21 |
| Vita Coconut Water (2)  |  No  | 11.1        |           -10 |       18 |       8 |
| Stilly Seltzers         | Yes  | 12          |            -2 |        8 |       6 |
| Truly Seltzers (1)      | Yes  | 12          |            -2 |       12 |      10 |
| Soju                    | Yes  | 12.7        |          -4.5 |        8 |    ~3.5 |
| Castle Danger Cream Ale | Yes  | 12          |            -6 |        8 |       2 |

* (1) Brought by friends, *thank you!*
* (2) Usually Kirkland Signature is great, in this case skip the generic
and [buy the name brand](https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/products/18423613-vita-coco-coconut-water-pure-199-8-fl-oz).

This time Pineapple Juice was the wild-card, and unfortunately it didn't
pan out! At a previous party we hosted a friend brought a few and I loved
the idea of having cans of juice for a “flat” option that is sweet and non-alcoholic.
Soda, coconut water and Chi Forest dominated the non-alcoholic category.

Chi Forest comes in 4 flavors, and there is a significant difference between which
flavors were popular. Unfortunately you can't buy individual flavors of
Chi Forest at Costco, only a 24-unit variety pack.
Personally my favorite flavor is Pomelo, so I'm not complaining about leftovers.

| Beverage                | # Before | # After |
|-------------------------|----------|---------|
| Chi Forest (Lychee)     | 6        | 1       |
| Chi Forest (Peach)      | 6        | 2       |
| Chi Forest (Pomelo)     | 6        | 4       |
| Chi Forest (Strawberry) | 6        | 5       |

Here's the overall stats by category. I can
use the number of attendees (~20) to approximately forecast
how much I should stock in a different year.

| Category          | Delta (floz) | Before (floz) | %   |
|-------------------|-------------:|--------------:|-----|
| Soda, Juice       |       264.42 |         480.0 | 55% |
| Coconut Water     |       111.00 |         199.8 | 56% |
| Flavored Spirits  |       105.15 |         341.6 | 30% |
| Beer              |        72.00 |          96.0 | 75% |
| All Alcholic      |       177.15 |         437.6 | 40% |
| All Non-Alcoholic |       375.42 |         679.8 | 55% |
| All Beverages     |       441.57 |        1117.4 | 39% |

Send me your favorite hosting tip or unique ways that you curate for others. I hope this little post inspired you to “juice” your *everyday human curation* 
with simple analytics in the future. 🍻 *Cheers!*
