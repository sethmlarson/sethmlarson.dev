# “For You” is not for me

I derive a lot of joy and meaning from being productive and engaging with people and projects I care about.

Towards doing more of that, I've done a bit of introspection and cost/benefit analysis of my waking hours.
One area that has continued to find low value is time spent on platforms that have multiple of the following features:

* Automatic fetching of new content, infinite scrolling
* Short, rapidly changing visual/audio content
* Suggested content alongside content you explicitly want ("for you")
* Large volumes of low-quality, unwanted, or upsetting content
* Content which isn't consumable with other people (unlike discussions, messages, calls, games)
* UI design that pushes you towards the above type of content

You might be thinking to yourself, "Seth, that is the entire internet right now".
**Unfortunately, you're mostly right!** Thankfully, it's not the whole internet,
but I don't think the platforms that are exhibiting these characteristics will
stop any time soon.

**Historically I have been very susceptible to the above type of platforms and content.**
I've caught myself frequently consuming content like this for much
longer than I originally intended to, thus leaving no time for activities which I value higher. In an attempt to combat this trend I have been removing many apps from my
phone to avoid having "opening an app" turning into an hour-long binge. To date I've removed the following apps from my phone and stopped visiting the websites (with the exception of cross-posting articles):

Facebook (long ago), Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitter. The most recent removal has been the YouTube app from my phone
once YouTube started pushing YouTube Shorts above long-form content, I still use YouTube on web. I've joined Blue Sky but am unsure if I really
want to "focus" on more than one social media platform. I don't plan on trying Threads right now.

## What platforms /do/ I use?

Of course, I still want to see content on the internet, including from many
of my friends! I continue to follow the hundreds of blogs, websites, and newsletters that I've enjoyed before purging platforms
through the lovely and relatively new reader and newsletter app [**Omnivore**](https://omnivore.app) (previously I used Feedly for RSS).
I use **[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@sethmlarson)** for the closest definition of social media.
For synchronous communication I use apps like **Signal**, **Discord**, and **Slack**.

I highly recommend picking up [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) or some other RSS/reader application to be able to keep track of
the websites and creators you're interested in without locking yourself into a given platform. If you do decide to use Omnivore, [please support their
team](https://opencollective.com/omnivore) to avoid yet another platform becoming enshittified or unsustainable. If you have the funds to do so, you should be supporting
creators you regularly enjoy content from, especially if you're not doing so through their platform which relies on ads.

Another thing I recently discovered was that some popular platforms like YouTube
have RSS feeds available which makes it possible to consume the content from a platform while avoiding the exploitative UI patterns (we'll see how long that lasts...).
One thing I've noted is that by consuming content this way it disincentives me from continuing to purchase YouTube Red since I'm having to
watch their ads outside the app anyway now...

For finding novel content, I'm relying on my friends sharing things with me or seeing them on Mastodon.
I also still frequent Hacker News as a way of finding new tech content or creators.

If you're interested in content that I create or interacting with me over the internet I recommend
the following platforms:

* [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@sethmlarson)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/users/481989102951202817)
* [Email](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com)
* [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/sethmlarson)
* [RSS](https://sethmlarson.dev/feed)

At least for now these platforms get directly to the source (people) and don't have most of the problems listed above. Stay safe out there, friends! 👻
