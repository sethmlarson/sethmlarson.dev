# Transferring ‚ÄúUTF8.XYZ‚Äù

<!-- more -->

I'm transferring the [UTF8.XYZ domain](https://utf8.xyz) and [service](https://github.com/sethmlarson/utf8.xyz) to
[Trey Hunner](https://treyhunner.com/), a friend and beloved member of the Python community.
Trey and I have talked about making this transfer many times
at <nobr>PyCon US's</nobr> across the years, and now it's finally happening!

I've taken the opportunity to refresh the service and publish
one last revision introducing support for Unicode 17.0.0 and Python 3.13.
Big thank you to Trey for taking this on.

## Wait... what's UTF8.XYZ?

If this is your first time hearing of the service, that's okay! I created
this simple service in 2020 because I wanted to easily grab emojis,
em-dashes, and other Unicode characters that I used frequently throughout
the day. There aren't any ads, pesky pop-ups, or fluff: only a button to
copy the character into your buffer.

You can use `curl` from the terminal to grab characters easily there, too:

```shell
$ curl https://utf8.xyz/waving-hand-sign
üëã
```

Simple, right?
