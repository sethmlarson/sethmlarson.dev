# BrotliCFFI has two new maintainers

Quick post announcing that the Python package
[brotlicffi](https://pypi.org/project/brotlicffi) has two new maintainers:
[Nathan Goldbaum](https://ngoldbaum.github.io/) and [Christian Clauss](https://github.com/cclauss).
Thank you both for stepping up to help me with
this package.

Both these folks (along with a few others) have shown up
and gotten straight to work in adding support for Python 3.14,
free-threaded Python,
and the latest release of Brotli. I’ve given myself the task
to [change the PyPI publishing workflow](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlicffi/issues/209) to allow a group of contributors
to make new releases *to mostly get out of their way!*

I’m grateful that the project lives under the [python-hyper](https://github.com/python-hyper) organization
which is structured in such
a way that allows onboarding new contributors quickly after they’ve
shown interest in contributing to a project meaningfully.
