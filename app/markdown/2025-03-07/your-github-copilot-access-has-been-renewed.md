# Your GitHub Copilot access has been renewed ðŸ¤¡

As a maintainer of a "[popular open source project](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/#:~:text=popular%20open%20source%20projects)"
ever since Copilot was announced I've been receiving
monthly reminders that my free GitHub Copilot access has been renewed.

If I was paying for the service this would be a simple billing
reminder, no worries. The only trouble is *there is no off switch for maintainers who aren't interested*.
I have never once used Copilot and actively avoid generative AI features
in every product I use, GitHub is no different.

But no, GitHub insists on sending me this email every month with no way to
opt-out or disable Copilot. I've tried contacting support and I received no help.

I could create a filter for these emails, but I cannot be
the only one that is receiving these emails. Asking hundreds or thousands of people
to all opt-out of your spammy emails is not the answer here.

For completeness, here are what my Copilot settings look like in GitHub. Note that the "Enabled" label next to "Copilot in Github.com" is not editable. I don't see a way to disable Copilot or cancel my "subscription".
If I'm the one doing something wrong here, please correct me, but I've asked about this on social media before with no responses from anyone.
