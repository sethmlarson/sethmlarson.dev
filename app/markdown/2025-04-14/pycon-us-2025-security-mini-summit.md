# Security events at PyCon US 2025! üêçüõ°Ô∏è

There's many security-related talks, open spaces, and meetups at PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh, PA. Don't miss out:

* [Alpha-Omega and PSF engagement year-in-review](#alpha-omega-and-psf-engagement-year-in-review)
* [Meet the Developer's-in-Residence](#meet-the-developers-in-residence)
* [Supply-Chain Security Mini-Track](#supply-chain-security-mini-track)
* [Security-related Talks](#security-related-talks)

## Alpha-Omega and PSF engagement year-in-review

Alpha-Omega sponsors tons of security work at the Python Software Foundation
and in the Python ecosystem. This [talk is an update for Alpha-Omega's
engagement with the Python Software Foundation](https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/153/).
The talk happens on Thursday before the main conference, so if you're not able
to make it you can read the PSF's update in the [Alpha-Omega 2024 Annual Report](https://alpha-omega.dev/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/01/Alpha-Omega-Annual-Report-2024_012925.pdf).

## Meet the Developers-in-Residence

During the opening reception the Python Software Foundation booth is hosting
a "[Meet the Developers-in-Residence](https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/)" meet-and-greet session at the Python Software
Foundation booth in the Expo Hall. This is a
great chance to introduce yourself, ask questions about our work,
and find out what we're all focusing on in 2025 and beyond.

Seth Larson, Mike Fiedler, and ≈Åukasz Langa will be the
attending Developers-in-Residence.

## Supply-Chain Security Mini-Track

Did you know that I'm co-organizing an [open source supply-chain security mini-track](https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/open-spaces/#:~:text=Supply-Chain%20Security)
with [Dustin Ingram](https://dustingram.com) during PyCon US 2025 open spaces? This mini-track is for both
users and maintainers of open source projects and will feature multiple
short talks and discussions. Come meet your fellow Pythonistas that
are interested in security and learn from experts about the latest
best-practices and news.
