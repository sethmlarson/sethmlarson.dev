# Join the PyCon US 2025 Security Mini-Track! üêçüõ°Ô∏è

Did you know that I'm co-organizing an [open source supply-chain security mini-track](https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/open-spaces/#:~:text=Supply-Chain%20Security)
with [Dustin Ingram](https://dustingram.com) during PyCon US 2025 open spaces? This mini-track is for both
users and maintainers of open source projects and will feature multiple
short talks and discussions. Come meet your fellow Pythonistas that
are interested in security and learn from experts about the latest
best-practices and news.

## Talks and Discussions

The format will be a list of short talks followed by audience discussion.
The planned topics are:

* "Update on the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)" by Seth Larson
* "CVE and Open Source Software" by Shelby Cunningham and Madison Oliver
* "Security for Scientific Python (SPEC-8)" by Jarrod Millman

After the scheduled talks there may be time for lightning talks
which will be submitted closer to the mini-track.
Unfortunately the talks won't be recorded but a write-up will
be produced with some notes about the event and discussions.
