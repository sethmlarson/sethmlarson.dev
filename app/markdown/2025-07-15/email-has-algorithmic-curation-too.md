# Email has algorithmic curation, too

Communication technologies should optimally be reliable, especially when both parties have opted-in to consistent reliable delivery. I don't want *someone else* to decide whether I receive a text message or email from a friend.

I associate "algorithmic curation" with social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, or Instagram. I don't typically think about email as a communication technology that contains algorithmic curation. Maybe that thinking should change?

Email for most people has algorithmic curation applied by their email provider. Email providers like Gmail automatically filter the email and decide which "category" the email ends up in, regardless of how much you trust the sender or if you have opted-in to their emails.
Some of these categories are harmless, like "Social", where social media updates will be filtered into its own category but not hidden in any meaningful way.

<p>The category that is destructive is one we know and love: "Spam". Spam filtering is usually a good thing, if you've ever looked in the folder you understand why it exists. However, many email providers don't give a way to opt-out of spam filtering, even for senders that have sent you hundreds of high-quality opted-in emails.</p>

Where this is relevant is for email newsletters. I publish an email newsletter for this blog, and yet I would prefer you not use the newsletter and **instead use RSS**.
If you enjoy the blog's content enough to get a notification when there's more, then you probably want delivery to be reliable.

My previous email was sent to the Spam folder for at least Gmail, and from [reading the email](https://buttondown.com/sethmlarson/archive/setting-discord-status-from-physical-gamecube/)
I am not sure why this would be the case. The language isn't any different from the rest of my emails, and yet the number of deliveries and opens is less than half of a typical email.

As someone trying to communicate to readers, what am I supposed to learn or do in this situation? Just like with other
algorithmically curated platforms, I feel like I'm at the mercy of a process that isn't understandable
and prone to change without warning.

**Reliable communication technologies like RSS are the answer**. If you're a regular consumer of internet content I highly recommend installing an RSS feed reader.
My personal recommendation (that I use and pay for) is [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com). You'd be surprised which platforms offer RSS
as a reliable alternative to their typical curation approach, for example YouTube offers RSS feeds for channels.

As a web surfer I hope this article inspires you to choose a reliable communication technology like RSS when "subscribing" to internet creatives so you never miss another publication.
If you're a publisher, providing your content through a reliable opt-in medium like RSS, Patreon, or even Discord means only you
and your readers are in control of who sees your content.
