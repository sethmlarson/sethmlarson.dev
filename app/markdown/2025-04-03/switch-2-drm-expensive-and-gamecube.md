# Nintendo Switch 2: DRM, expensive, and GameCube

So the Switch 2 got announced in a [Nintendo Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM) yesterday. The event
itself was essentially an unending series of incredible new
information about the Switch 2 console and games. Here are my mixed
thoughts, especially about things that weren't included in the live stream.

## New physical cartridges that don't work offline

I saw on Mastodon that there's a new cartridge coming for the Switch 2
called a "[Game-Key Card](https://support.nintendo.com/switch2/gamekeycard)".
The existence of this cartridge is disappointing to me, it's essentially
the worst of both worlds for both physical and digital downloads. This
cartridge type combines the [now more expensive medium](#switch-2-might-be-expensive) (physical)
with the medium that removes user rights, preservation, and long-term utility (digital).

Presumably the new "Game Key" cartridges only contain the equivalent of
an activation and decryption key along with a link to a download server
for installing the game. What this means in practice is the following:

* You can no longer sell your physical cartridges. 
* You can no longer lend your physical cartridges, you need to use Nintendo's
  new game sharing service which will one day be shut down.
* You can no longer buy physical cartridges without first verifying that
  they had never been installed previously. This might be impossible to do
  depending on the UI of the Switch 2 prior to installation.
* You need to purchase more or larger microSD cards as now every game you purchase
  needs to be saved to your Switch instead of being stored in the cartridge.
* If you don't download and install your game before game servers are taken
  down then you won't be able to use your purchase.

Despite all the above downsides you *still* need to have your cartridge plugged
into the Switch for the game to work, presumably because the content is encrypted
even when on your microSD card. So you don't even get the biggest upsides of digital content: portability and convenience.

I will be curious to see how often this type of game cartridge is used. Apparently
a similar mechanism was already happening with existing Switch 1 cartridges.
Some publishers would provide the bare-minimum software in a Switch 1 cartridge and then
rely on the Nintendo Switch Game Update service to install the full contents of the game.

This new game cartridge type is effectively making this approach to distribution blessed by Nintendo.
In a way this is better because the game will be labeled correctly that the contents
of the game require an internet connection to run completely, but I suspect it will
also mean that this technique will be more common amongst publishers.

All-in-all, this means that when Nintendo shuts down Nintendo Switch online in ~20 years and your
Switch console or microSD card are damaged you will lose access to your collection.
There is no legal way to produce a backup of your games that incorporate
encryption like the Switch cartridges thanks to the DMCA.

## Switch 2 might be expensive?

The Switch 2 itself costs $450 USD with a single-game bundle
cost of $500 USD. Inflation-adjusted the Switch 1 cost $390 USD
in today's money back in 2017, so $450 is a 15% cost increase on
launch. I am less concerned about this price difference given it's
a one-time purchase, the Switch 2 is a backwards compatible console,
and that the Switch family has proven shown itself to be a very
valuable entertainment investment.

The very first game announced for the Switch 2 is Mario Kart World,
an open-world party kart game. **This game is going to cost $80 USD for a
physical copy of the game and $70 USD for a digital-only copy**.
This is the **first Nintendo title to cost $80 USD** and the first
Nintendo title to have a price **difference between physical and
digital editions**. Lots of implications for this...

The difference in cost between physical and digital makes sense to me.
Creating something physical in the world is not
free, there is some associated cost. However, the video game preservationist in me
is frustrated that there's a continued march down the path of not being
able to actually own the content you purchase.

As a physical game collector I now need to decide how much my principles are worth,
probably more than $10 but for games which are sold as "Game-Key Cards"
this price is absolutely not worth it. **I do not recommend buying Game-Key Cards**,
just go digital if you really want the game and this is the only physical cartridge option.

If there were more protections
for making legal backups of digital content then none of this would be an issue.

As far as the actual prices, I am hoping that Mario Kart, likely one
of the best games for every Nintendo console, is an exception rather than
a rule for this price. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold 67M units, 10M more than the second-best
selling Switch game. Knowing what I know now about the Switch I would pay
$80 for *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe!*

I worry that other publishers, and even Nintendo themselves, are going to try
to push the envelope on game prices. It's never made much sense why every
game that's not "indie" needs to be $60 USD, so I hope that consumers feel that way
too and don't fall for publishers pushing games that are not "Mario Kart"-levels of quality
for even more ludicrous
prices beyond the industry-standard $60 USD.

Maybe higher prices will also make
the job of game journalists and reviewers even more important and fewer people
pre-order games, I think this would be a good development if game prices increase.

## Switch 2 requires microSD Express cards

If you bought a bunch of large microSD cards because they'll be useful
"one-day", then you'll be a bit disappointed by this one. The Switch 2
requires microSD Express cards. I personally don't own any microSD Express cards
but have a handful of 256GB+ microSD cards without "Express".

Doing a quick price check on Amazon shows that a 256GB San-Disk microSD card
without "Express" (150MB/s reads) costs $20 USD and with "Express" (880MB/s reads)
costs $60 USD. So you might be buying a brand new and more expensive
microSD card for your Switch 2 just to store all the games.

This is another part of the price of the Switch 2 to consider when purchasing.

## Single-Pak/Download Play is back with GameShare

What's old is new again: the Switch 2 supports playing
a single copy of a game across multiple consoles with
a new feature called "[GameShare](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/)". This
feature is similar to the DS and 3DS "Download Play"
and the Game Boy Advance "Single-Pak" play modes.
Even better: Switch 1 consoles are able to "receive"
games being hosted by the Switch 2 (but are unable to "host" the games).

Despite being a "handheld" console, the Switch 1 didn't originally support
such a feature. This meant that the Switch was the first handheld
that lacked this feature since the Game Boy Color from 1998.

## Switch 2 will be the console of GameCube?

The announcement [contained a ton of information about GameCube games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MvkSVs8f_w) for the
Switch 2. GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online, in particular
I'm excited for F-Zero GX and Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness which I
don't own myself but have always wanted to try.

There's also a new GameCube controller for the Switch that actually uses the
classic indigo color, definitely need to get my hands on one.

Finally, they teased [Kirby Air Riders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVsNMp_nAU)
which appears to be the sequel to Kirby Air Ride on the GameCube.
This game was a favorite of mine and my brother, especially the "City Trial"
mode. With Sakurai returning as the director I'm not too worried about
the game being a hit, but I do hope they keep a "City Trial"-esque mode
instead of making the game all about racing.
