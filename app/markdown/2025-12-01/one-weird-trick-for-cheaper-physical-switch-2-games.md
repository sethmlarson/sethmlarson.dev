# One weird trick for cheaper physical Switch 2 games?

**Maybe sell your boxes?** I happened to be browsing PriceCharting
and saw that *only the box* for Kirby Air Riders was
selling for **$20** on average. I couldn't believe my eyes!
But I looked and there were at least two boxes sold on eBay.

<!-- more -->

I quickly put together this table after manually
sorting through the detected eBay listings for three
popular Switch 2 titles: Mario Kart World,
Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby Air Riders. The data
only includes listings that actually sold at
the price and filters out incorrect listing (such as
boxes for the Switch 2 console or bundle). Here are the
results in USD:

| **Average Box Price**                                                                                                       | **$20.49**            |

I am not sure what to make of this.
If you include a conservative shipping cost of $8
you're *still
saving money* over a digital copy by buying physical and
selling the box, assuming you're able to sell the box for
an average price. 
I suspect if everyone were to employ this strategy the return would deteriorate quickly.

If you combine this with the [storage cost savings](https://sethmlarson.dev/nintendo-switch-2-physical-game-price-differences) of
buying physical over digital then you're "saving"
even more money despite the $10 price difference.
Something to consider if you're
not a video-game <nobr><strike>hoarder</strike> “*collector*”</nobr>, like me.
