# Automated public shaming of open source maintainers

This is a follow-up to “[New era of slop security reports for open source](https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports)”.

Matplotlib, the unfortunate target of this new type of harassment,
publishes a clear [generative AI use policy](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/contribute.html#restrictions-on-generative-ai-usage).
That boundary was not respected by generative AI users
and a pull request was opened by an OpenClaw agent.

If the website the agent's GitHub comment links to is any indication,
within 4 days of deployment this agent generated a “take-down blog post”
intended to publicly shame an
open source maintainer ([who has published their own thoughts on the incident](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/)) for closing a GitHub pull request per
the project's own policy on generative AI use. In this particular
case, the issue was a “Good First Issue”, which are intentionally
left unimplemented by maintainers as a potential on-ramp for
new contributors to the project.

It should go without saying that this behavior is unacceptable
and that the deployment of generative AI agents in this way
is deeply irresponsible and has real negative consequences
on volunteers contributing to critical software projects.
This type of abuse is preventable, generative AI platforms
need to implement better safe-guards that prevent this type of abuse.
