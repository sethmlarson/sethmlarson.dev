# How to disable Copilot in GitHub?

For the first time in months GitHub has released
a feature that I actually enjoy: a way to disable
Copilot on the home screen. Thanks to [Harry Sintonen](https://infosec.
exchange/@harrysintonen/113854967426639851) for [sharing this on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@harrysintonen@infosec.exchange/113854967522484490):

* Login to `github.com`
* Profile -> Settings -> Copilot
* "Dashboard entry point" -> Select "Disabled"
* While you're here, disable the rest.
* Don't forget to [leave any feedback you have](https://github.com/copilot) 
  in the (...) menu, too.

I am not holding my breath that GitHub will
start delivering more features that actually benefit users
any time soon ([GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.
com/orgs/community/discussions?
discussions_q=is%3Aopen+github+security+advisories+sort%3Atop)? Remember that feature?)

Seeing a cascade of users disabling Copilot
might provide enough signal that they are wasting
their time pushing these useless features down everyone's
throats.
