# New ROM dumping tool for SNES & Super Famicom from Epilogue

Just heard the news from the [WULFF Den Podcast](https://youtu.be/w7l4lFqndRc?t=2838) that [Epilogue](https://www.epilogue.co)
has released pre-orders for the next ROM backup tool in their “Operator”
series for the [Super NES (SNES) and Super Famicom](https://www.epilogue.co/product/sn-operator)
called the “[SN Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/sn-operator)”.
The SN Operator pre-order costs $60 USD plus shipping.

This is great news for collectors and people interested in
owning and playing SNES and Super Famicom games without a
subscription service and for [cheaper than purchasing a console](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/super-nintendo/super-nintendo-system),
currently hovering around $120 USD on eBay. If there's only one or
two games you're interested in playing and ownership isn't
a huge deal for you: Nintendo Switch Online offers a [substantial SNES
and Super Famicom library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Classics#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) for $20/year.

Most importantly, these devices are important to provide legal
pathways for enthusiasts to archive
and play their aging collection on newer storage mediums and devices.
Emulation does not equate to piracy, and ROM dumpers
are an important tool for legal emulation and archiving.
I've [previously written](https://sethmlarson.dev/backup-game-boy-roms-and-saves-on-ubuntu) about using the [GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator) from Epilogue
with Ubuntu to successfully archive my Game Boy, Game Boy Color,
and Game Boy Advance ROMs and save files.

I personally won't be buying this product as my collection
doesn't have any SNES games. Is there a game in particular
that I missed out on from this era? Let me know.

Their website also features a teaser for *another* upcoming
Operator! The Wulff brothers guessed that this would likely
be an N64 Operator, especially given the N64's prominence
with the new [Analogue 3D](https://www.analogue.co/3d) console. An N64 operator similarly wouldn't be super useful for me,
I am holding out hope for a SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive Operator in the future.
