<p>The <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com/">Delta emulator</a> which I've used for mobile retro-gaming in
the past has added beta support for SEGA Genesis and Master System
games! Riley and Shane made the announcement through the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/delta-2-0b2-sega-145997435">Delta emulator
Patreon</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.com/@delta_emulator/post/DSVyQtaj7lZ">also on Mastodon</a>.
</p>
<p>You can install the emulator on iOS through the “TestFlight”
application to get access right away. I've done so and tested
many of my favorite games including the Sonic the Hedgehog
and the Streets of Rage trilogies and found that the emulator
handled these games flawlessly.</p>

<p>The addition of SEGA Genesis support in Delta is quite exciting for me as the Genesis was my first console. I've amassed quite the collection of SEGA
Genesis ROMs from the <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/extracting-genesis-and-game-gear-roms-from-sega-gamecube-collections">Sonic Mega Collection on the GameCube</a> and
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/sega-genesis-and-mega-drive-games-and-roms-from-steam">the SEGA Classics collection</a> previously available on Steam.
Now I can play any of these games on the go, but I'll probably need to buy a simple Bluetooth controller
with a D-Pad for the hand ergonomics.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly: did you know that the AltStore <a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2025/10/07/evolving-altstore-pal/">is connected to
the Fediverse now</a>? Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>Have you tried the Delta emulator or grow up playing SEGA Genesis games like me? Let me know your favorite game from this era!</p>
