# Python listed as memory-safe language in latest CISA recommendations

Memory-safety is clearly a top priority for software security, making up [70% of vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/urgent-need-memory-safety-software-products) in popular software like Chrome and Windows.
The US Government RFI on open source security had a focus area on memory-safety to which the [Python Software Foundation provided a response](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ONCD-2023-0002-0107),
for which I was the primary author on this topic.

The US government organization CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) [issued new recommendations this week](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/)
regarding securing software products through memory safety. You can read the [full information sheet here](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF).

From the recommendation I have the following quote, emphasis mine:

> ‚ÄúRecommended memory safe programming languages mentioned in the CSI include C#, Go, Java, **Python**, Rust, and Swift.‚Äù

**This is awesome news for Python users!** ü•≥

More support will be needed to migrate Python's extensive packaging ecosystem from memory-unsafe languages
to memory-safe languages. I've made recommendations on how best the US government can aid in that effort in the PSF's RFI response.
My recommendations included:

* Provide resources (financial or time) to aid in discovery, improving tooling (like [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3)), and the actual migration of projects.
* Prioritizing projects for migration based on security-sensitivity and criticality.
* Learning from the experiences of projects which have migrated from C to Rust like [cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Eiy2W0APU).
* Hardening for projects which can't migrate to memory-safe languages for a variety of reasons.

You can see the current usage of memory-unsafe languages in Python projects [in a previous article](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-18).
