<p>Apparently I talk about my love for Post Malone's music too much, because I received <em>not one, but two</em> unsolicited packages of <a href="https://www.oreo.com/products/post-malone">Post Malone Oreos</a>
from a friend and a neighbor. So put in your diamond grills and let's try them!</p>

<div class="hidden-sm">

<div style="background-repeat: no-repeat; animation: rotation 30s infinite linear; width:300px; height:300px; margin:10px; background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/oreo.png); -webkit-shape-outside: circle(50%, 50%, 49%); shape-outside: circle(49% at 50% 50%); -webkit-shape-margin: 10px; shape-margin: 10px;     -webkit-background-size: contain; -moz-background-size: contain; -o-background-size: contain;background-size: contain;"></div>
</center>
</div>

<p>Opening the package was a burst of caramel,
like a caramel-scented candle
from Bath &amp; Body Works. The smell was so potent I would not be surprised if they didn't pump that in prior to sealing the packaging.</p>

<p>The actual flavor was not as strong, but still pretty sweet (enough to give you a <nobr><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Carat_Toothache">12Kt toothache</a></nobr>). The salt and the shortbread
were welcome in toning down the caramel sweetness.</p>

<p>Overall I liked the cookies! If you're a fan of Oreos and caramel then they are a must-try!</p>

If you're curious about the circular word-wrapping (check out the page on desktop) I read this lovely [article
about CSS shapes](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/) from [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/).
I cropped a picture of an Oreo using iPhone's "Smart Select" feature for making stickers
and exported that as a PNG.
