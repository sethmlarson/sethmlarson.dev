# Blogrolls are the Best(rolls)

Happy 6-year blogiversary to me! 🎉 To celebrate
I want to talk about *other peoples’ blogs*, more specifically
the magic of “[blogrolls](https://indieweb.org/blogroll)”.
Blogrolls are “lists of other sites that you read, are a follower of, or recommend”.
Any blog can host a blogroll, or sometimes websites can be [one big blogroll](https://blogroll.org/).

I’ve hosted a [blogroll](https://sethmlarson.dev/blogroll) on my own blog [since 2023](https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/commit/bb1878ed81db05d194d350e108176241f339362e)
and encourage other bloggers to do so. My own blogroll is [generated](https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/tree/main/archive) from the list of RSS
feeds I subscribe to and articles that I “favorite” within [my RSS reader](https://inoreader.com).
If you want to be particularly fancy you can add an RSS feed ([example](https://henry.codes/recent-reading/)) to your blogroll
that provides readers a method to “subscribe” for future blogroll updates.

Blogrolls are like catnip for me: I cannot resist opening and `Ctrl`-clicking
every link until I can’t see my tabs anymore. The feeling is akin to the first deep breath
of air before starting a hike: there’s a rush of new information, topics, and potential new blogs
to follow.

Blogrolls can bridge the “effort chasm” I frequently
hear as an issue when I recommend folks try an RSS feed reader. We’re not used to
empty feeds anymore; self-curating blogs until you receive multiple articles
per day takes time and effort. Blogrolls can help here, especially ones that
publish using the importable [OPML format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/refs/heads/main/archive/feeds.opml).

You can instantly populate your feed reader app with hundreds of feeds
from blogs that are likely relevant to you. Simply create an account on
a feed reader, [import the blogroll OPML document](https://www.inoreader.com/blog/2014/05/opml-subscriptions.html) from a blogger you enjoy,
and watch the articles “roll” in. Blogrolls are almost like Bluesky
“Starter Packs” in this way!

Hopefully this has convinced you to either curate your own blogroll
or to start looking for (or asking for!) blogrolls from your favorite
writers on the Web. Share your favorite blogroll with me on email or social media.
