<p>
    This is a list of links to stuff on the internet that I enjoyed and want to share with others.
    There's not really a way to <em>subscribe</em> to this list, so you'll have to check back later for more!

<p>
    I share all the
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/refs/heads/master/archive/feeds.opml">RSS feeds</a>
    I follow and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/refs/heads/master/archive/articles.opml">article URLs</a>
    below using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a>, an open standard for sharing groups of links with text and other metadata.
    You can import the feeds directly into your reader app of choice (but beware, it's a firehose!)
